# DSA Collection

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. The repository is organized into five levels of complexity, ranging from basic linear structures to advanced research-level algorithms and modern paradigms.

## Structure

- **Level 1: Base** - Linear structures (Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues) and fundamental math.
- **Level 2: Intermediate** - Non-linear structures (Trees, Heaps, Graphs) and hashing.
- **Level 3: Advanced** - Core algorithms (Sorting, DP, Graph theory, String matching).
- **Level 4: Elite** - Advanced data structures (Link-Cut Trees, Succinct DS) and computational geometry.
- **Level 5: Research** - Modern paradigms (Learned DS, Quantum/Neural algorithms, Post-Quantum crypto).


## Usage

Compile any file using a standard C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -O3 level1/array_1d.cpp -o array_1d
./array_1d
```
